# DataScienceAcademy PBI Course

The Dashboards were not focused on having a great design, but rather on learning and replicating the concepts shown in the course and also on learning and understanding the features of the Power BI tool.

The data used (except for that in chapter 10) are fictitious data.

## About course

Course still in progress, I have currently completed approximately 50% of it, I still have basic statistics for data science, data cleaning and manipulation, Power Query and M language, Power BI + SQL, 2 ML projects and Power BI + Power Platform ahead of me.

I will not upload any PDF files or slides from the course out of respect for the school responsible for it.
